          <p>
            I'm from the Midwest but I've lived in Denver Colorado for nine
            years. I wasn't happy with my working circumstances so I decided to
            take the DU fullstack web development bootcamp. I am determined to
            acquire the skills necessary to start a new and rewarding career.
            Ask me about the time I watched six Siberian tigers eat a goose.
